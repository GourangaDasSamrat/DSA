# Problem 5: Merge and Sort Two Arrays

Write a function `mergeArrays` that takes in two arrays of integers and returns a new array that
contains all the elements from both arrays, sorted in ascending order.
For example, if the two input arrays are:
[1, 3, 5, 7, 9]
[2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
The function should return the following array:
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

**Status:** Passed
