# Problem 6: Find Shortest Word in String

Write a function called `findShortestWord` that takes in a string as a parameter and returns the
shortest word in the string. If there are two or more words that are the same length and shortest,
return the first word from the string with that length. Ignore punctuation and assume the string
will not be empty. Words may also contain numbers.
For example, if the input string is "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog", the function
should return "The".
