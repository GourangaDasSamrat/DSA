# Problem 1: Cricket Strike Rate Calculator

Write a function `calculateStrikeRate` that takes in two parameters - the runs scored by a
batsman and the total number of balls they faced. The function should return the batsman's
strike rate, which is calculated as the number of runs scored per 100 balls faced.
For example, if the batsman scored 45 runs off 30 balls, their strike rate would be calculated as
follows:
(45 / 30) \* 100 = 150
The function should round the strike rate to two decimal places.
