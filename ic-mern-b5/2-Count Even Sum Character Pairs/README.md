# Problem 2: Count Even Sum Character Pairs

Have the function `CountPairs` take in a string of lowercase letters and digits. The function
should return the count of all pairs of characters in the string that add up to an even number.
For example, if the input string is "a1b2c3d4e5f6", there are 3 pairs that add up to an even
number: "b2", "d4", and "f6". So the function should return 3.
If there are no such pairs, the function should return 0.
